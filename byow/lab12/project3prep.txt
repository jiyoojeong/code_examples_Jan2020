Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: the hexagons are like rooms and the connection of rooms via the tesselation is how the rooms will be connected

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: I would think about how to create just one room in the world.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway would be where multiple rooms are connected with doors, a room will only have one door.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I think mine was too specific to the 19-tesselation format and didn't consider broader possibilities. I would love to explore this more as we go on.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: you can first create hallways , and then randomly select edges of the hall to create doors. At every door, there will be a new space, of any input size as long as it doesn't
overlap another. Each room can be randomly determined to be either a hallway or a room. For every hallway, repeat this process, until at the end of every hallway will be just rooms.
